## Acceleration-Based User Authentication

This group project explores acceleration-based biometrics for user authentication using a Feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (FFMLP) neural network. Key features include analyzing user variance, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and performance evaluation through metrics like precision, recall, and Equal Error Rate (EER). The system is designed to classify genuine users and imposters effectively.
